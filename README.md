# Assignment JC1a

## Task 1

1. Install `git` on your computer.
1. Create a GitHub account. You will get a GitHub handle. For example, mine is `hisplan`.
1. Going forward, if you're asked to do something with git for this assigment, make sure you do it from Terminal on Mac or PowerShell on Windows.

## Task 2

1. Clone this repository `bcd-sandbox` onto your computer.
1. Under the `people` directory, create a text file (.txt), name the text file with your student ID. For example, if your student ID is `22316316`, the file name should be `22316316.txt`. Write your full name in the file. Besides this, you're not supposed to make any other changes on any other files.
1. Commit the changes.
1. Try to push the changes to this repository, but you will get an error message. Why do you think that this happens? Do what's necessary to resolve the issue.

## Task 3

1. Create your own repository in your GitHub account and name the repository as `bcd-test`.
1. Clone the repository onto your computer.
1. Add a file named `test.py`. Add this code to the file:

    ```python
    def model_A():
        print("do this.")


    def model_B():
        print("do that.")


    def model_C():
        print("do other thing.")


    model_A()
    model_B()
    model_C()
    ```

1. Commit the changes.
1. Push the changes.
1. Invite me to your repository as collaborator. If I don't reply back to your invitation, email me and inform me that you have invited me as collaborator.
1. Once I can collaborate with you on your repository, we will continue our conversation for this assignment. This assignment is not over yet!
